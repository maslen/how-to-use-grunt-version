# Example grunt-version usage

[grunt-verion](https://github.com/kswedberg/grunt-version) automatically changes version numbers in your grunt project.  Here's an example of how to use it.

 * Clone this project to your computer
 * Install dependencies, run `npm install`
 * Run `grunt` and then edit main.js to see a build version increment in the package.json
 * Run `grunt bump_minor` to see a minor version increment in the package.json
